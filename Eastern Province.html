 <h3>* History </h3>
<p> With the Supreme Court ruling that by 2007 the 1987 order of merging the two provinces, under the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Northern and Eastern was illegal and therefore the two provinces must be administered separately. This meant two separate flags for the Northern and Eastern provinces.

The Eastern Province flag was unveiled along with the Flag of Northern Province in Trincomalee, in May 2007. The Governor of the Eastern Province Rear Admiral Mohan Wijewickrema, also at the time the acting Governor of the Northern Province, handed over the two flags to each of the province's respective councilâ€™s Chief Secretary S. Rangarajah of the North, and Herath Abeyeweera, of the East at a ceremony at the Governor's Secretariat.</p>

<h3>*Controversy</h3>
<p>The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the major political party for the Sri Lankan Moors, says that the new Eastern Province flag design does not represent the Muslim community. Hassan Ali, the Deputy Minister of Supplementary Crops Development, raised the issue at the adjournment debate in the House not accepting the new flag that did not symbolize the Muslim community.</p>
